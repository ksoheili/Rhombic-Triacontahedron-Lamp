# Rhombic Triacontahedron Lamp

This project was a prototype to get started using Fusion 360.
It was my first ever Fusion project, so there was a lot to learn, but ultimately this is a great easy lamp to make with a few parts.


## Cost
#### ~ $25: Filament, wifi controller, RGB lights, solder, wires, glue, sand paper.
If you are on a budget, this is not too pricey if you have some PLA lying around.
I would reccomend changing some settings, but this project uses about 500g of PLA.
In total this will set you back around $25 if you have individual parts ready to go.
Otherwise it may push $50 if you need to buy everything to start off.

## Design
The design has 3 layers, a base, middle housing, and lid shade.

#### The Base

Hole for power line to be wired in, and USB port cut out.
Printed the usb plate separately and front panel due to measurement discrepencies. 
All parts were glued with guerilla glue, only one screw was used to pressure 
hold parts in place.

#### The Middle
The middle section houses the LEDs, mounting it on the base is pretty simple with 
the notches, and then adding glue. It has to be thick enough to prevent light from 
shining through. Even though in the photos the glow seems uniform, it glows mostly
through the top since the bottom is 15% infill. My original design had an issue
and caused the inner portion to print poorly, but this is fixed.

#### The lid
The lid is a 2mm thick, basically 2% infill to allow light to shine trough.
It is actually pretty strong and fits nicely on top. I used white silicone to fill
the gaps, but would reccomend superglue to seal the top on (no light shadows 
once is solidifies from inside).
